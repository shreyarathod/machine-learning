# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains two machine learning projects developed for different purposes.

## Project 1: Linear Regression Model for Second Hand Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the current price of second-hand cars based on various parameters. The model takes eight input features: years, km, rating, condition, economy, top speed, horsepower (hp), and torque. Using linear regression techniques, it estimates the price of a car, aiding buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Project 2: Convolutional Neural Network for Malaria Detection

This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the detection of malaria in blood cell images. Trained on a dataset comprising nearly 24,000 images labeled as 'parasitized' or 'unparasitized', the CNN analyzes cell images, extracting features through convolutional, normalization, and pooling layers. The extracted features are then flattened and fed into dense layers for classification, ultimately determining whether a cell is parasitized or not.
