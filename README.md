# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains three machine learning projects developed for different purposes.

## Second Hand Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting the current price of second-hand cars based on various parameters. The model takes eight input features: years, km, rating, condition, economy, top speed, horsepower (hp), and torque. Using linear regression techniques, it estimates the price of a car, aiding buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Malaria Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the detection of malaria in blood cell images. Trained on a dataset comprising nearly 24,000 images labeled as 'parasitized' or 'unparasitized', the CNN analyzes cell images, extracting features through convolutional, normalization, and pooling layers. The extracted features are then flattened and fed into dense layers for classification, ultimately determining whether a cell is parasitized or not.

## Next Word Predictor using Bidirectional LSTM

This project develops a next word prediction model using a news dataset. By employing Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, the model predicts the next word in a sequence of words provided as input. This involves tokenizing the text data, mapping tokens to indices, and using these indices to train the LSTM model. The aim is to accurately predict subsequent words in a given text context.
